# elementary-stable-rpms

This repository has been split up into repositories for [elementary-staging] and
[elementary-appcenter]. The first contains packages of official elementary
packages, the second contains packages of "made for elementary" projects, all of
which aren't ready for inclusion in fedora (yet).

[elementary-staging]: https://github.com/decathorpe/elementary-staging-rpms
[elementary-appcenter]: https://github.com/decathorpe/elementary-appcenter-rpms
